# FIFO-Asynchronous
This project implements an Asynchronous FIFO buffer using Verilog. An asynchronous FIFO is a critical design in digital systems where data is transferred between two clock domains with different frequencies or phases. It ensures reliable data transfer without loss or corruption, addressing metastability issues through proper synchronization
